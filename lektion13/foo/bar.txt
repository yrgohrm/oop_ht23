In realms of code, where algorithms race, stand three companions: Foo, Bar, and
Baz. Like stars in a programmer's sky, they shine as variables of lore. Foo, the
pioneer, charts the path with placeholders unknown, while Bar follows
faithfully, a companion in every code zone. Yet, it's Baz that adds the twist,
the wildcard in logic's rhyme, completing the trio's dance in lines of elegant
code, transcending space and time.
